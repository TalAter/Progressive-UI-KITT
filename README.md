> A flexible GUI for progressive web apps

Progressive UI KITT makes it easy to add a GUI to progressive web apps.

## Progressive UI KITT is currently under heavy construction!

Feel free to **Star** and **Watch** it, but watch out for falling debris, and a wildly changing API.

Feedback and contributions are always welcome and appreciated.
